# Pre-Man Test Specs

Auto-generated API test specifications for **Watcher1223/hack_the_spack_backend**.

## What is this?

This folder contains machine-readable (and human-readable) API test specs
generated by [Pre-Man](https://github.com/Pre-Man).  They serve as
documentation-as-code and are consumed by the Pre-Man executor to run
deterministic API tests.

## Folder layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `requests/*.yaml` | One file per endpoint — method, path, auth, assertions |
| `schemas/*.schema.json` | JSON Schemas for request/response validation |
| `schemas/components.json` | Shared schema definitions (`$defs`) |
| `examples/*.json` | Request/response example payloads |
| `env/dev.yaml` | Environment config (base URL, required env vars) |
| `workflows/smoke.yaml` | Ordered smoke-test sequence |

## Running locally

```bash
# 1. Set required env vars (see env/dev.yaml)
export PREMAN_BEARER_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# 2. Run the smoke test
preman run --workflow smoke --env dev
```

## Secrets

**Never commit secrets.** This folder uses `${VAR}` placeholders for
sensitive values.  Set them via environment variables or create a local
`.preman/env/local.yaml` (add to `.gitignore`).
